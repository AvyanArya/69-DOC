There are three types of variables in JS

1. var
2. let
3. const

var - no errors on mistakes, global scope - exists throughout the program 
let - we get errors on mistakes, block scope - only exists in the place where is it defined, not outside of it 
const - a constant variable that cannot be reassigned another value
